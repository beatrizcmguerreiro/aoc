# Advent of Code
Personal repository for my [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) solutions.

## About Advent of Code
**Advent of Code** is an [Advent calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advent_calendar) of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. One programming puzzle a day is released from December 1st, divided in **two** parts (the second of which is unlocked AFTER solving the first). Advent of Code is created by [Eric Wastl](https://was.tl/), and is 100% free. If you like Advent Of Code and want to support its creator, you can donate to him [here](https://adventofcode.com/2025/support). If you want to hang out with other fellow coders, discuss about puzzles and solutions, or just have a look around, you can join the official subreddit: [r/adventofcode](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/).
